<h5> Football </h5>
<p> I like football because it helps to build stamina strength and speed. <br> 
    It is dealt with teamwork and also individual's role. It boosts <b> confidence </b> <br>
     It is exciting to watch and competitive. It deals with time management. It improves bone-strength, co-ordination. <br>
      It is <b> controlling ball with foot </b> and scoring goals which makes me feel more excited and curious to watch. </p> <br>
